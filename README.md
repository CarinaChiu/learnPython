# learnPython
Learn about Python basics!

## Step 1 - Learning the Language
Create an account on ![CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) and login. Navigate to the lessons on ![Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python).

Work through these tutorials. If you've programmed before, a lot of it won't be new to you. However, it's always a good idea to make sure you know the proper syntax when learning a new language. 

## Step 2 - Get a Compiler
Once you've got the basics of Python down, it's time to pick a ![compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler). You can either use ![Repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/python3), an online IDE for Python, or the ![standalone Python IDLE](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Note that we're using Python 3. If you've never programmed before, we reccomend using Repl.it

You can now get started writing your own programs!

## Step 3 - Write Your Own Programs

#### Writing Programs with Repl.it
Writing programs with Repl.it is incredibly easy. Type your program on the left and hit *run ►* once you're ready to go!

#### Writing Programs with IDLE
While it's still pretty easy to write programs in Python, it still requires some extra steps compared to Repl.it. Open up Python IDLE. Go to *File → New Program* and Python will create a new *.py* file for you to enter code into. Once you're satisfied with your code, go to *Run → Run Module*. Note that if you're using OS X, you might need to make sure you open any *.py* files with IDLE, not with Xcode.

#### I forgot everything I learned from codecademy! What do I do?
As long as you still remember a little bit, you're fine. Poke around on [Intro To Python](http://introtopython.org/), and if you can't find what you're looking for on there, just use [Google!](http://bfy.tw/E5IP)

## Step 4 - Try a Challenge
We've prepared some challenges for you! The ones at the top are the easiest, the ones at the bottom more difficult.
